    "text": "In collaboration with Ph.D. candidate Yin Yu, I developed EarBloom, a fashionable wearable prototype designed to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, during a research project (06/2021 – 07/2021). The project involved creating detailed CAD models, conducting functional simulations in Rhino 3D, and performing material stress tests in Fusion 360 to ensure durability and feasibility. The research findings were presented at a faculty seminar and later published in the Journal of Student Research (September 2021). Discover more about the project here."

    "text": "During my internship with NYU Pathways to AI (09/2023 – 12/2023), I developed a script leveraging a pre-trained Detectron2 classification model to analyze videos featuring hand movements. This project demonstrated the semi-effective tracking of hands within dynamic, real-world contexts, such as DIY YouTube videos. Built with OpenCV2, Detectron2, and Google Colab, this effort reflects my hands-on experience with cutting-edge machine learning tools and object detection frameworks.
