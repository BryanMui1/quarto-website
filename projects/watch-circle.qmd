As part of the AWS + Slalom Innovation Challenge (03/2023 â€“ 06/2023), I developed WatchCircle, a social media platform tailored for the 2028 LA Olympics, aimed at boosting user engagement and viewership. The project included designing a robust tech framework using AWS database technologies to ensure user data protection. Additionally, I pitched a Figma app prototype and a comprehensive business model to the official LA 2028 Olympics board of representatives, combining technological innovation with strategic vision.
